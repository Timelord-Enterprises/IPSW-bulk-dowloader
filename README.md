First and foremost, Welcome to my first programming project.
I wrote code in the past at school but wasn't very comfortable with it. 
But I love playing around in command-line now.

# IPSW-bulk-downloader
A tool to bulk download user-defined versions of iOS, iPadOS and tvOS.
The purpose of this script is to download all current releases of Apple's mobile operating system.  Useful if you need to store them on your hard drive for troubleshooting or place them on a caching server.

-Run the script by running Terminal found in your Utilities folder inside the folder where all the Applications live.
(If needed use chmod 777 commands to modify execution rights).
-The script will ask for the latest release.

A folder will be created on the desktop named "IPSW_Downloads" and the download will start.
